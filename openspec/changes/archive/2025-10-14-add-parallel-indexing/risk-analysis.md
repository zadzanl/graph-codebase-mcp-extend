### 2. Dependency Incompatibility Risk ⚠️⚠️

**Risk ID**: RISK-002  
**Severity**: High  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Overall Rating**: **CRITICAL**

#### Description
Third-party dependencies (Neo4j driver, NumPy, OpenAI SDK, tiktoken) may have unknown compatibility issues with free-threaded Python, potentially causing crashes, data corruption, or GIL re-enablement.

#### Impact Analysis
- **Neo4j Driver**: Connection failures, data corruption, deadlocks
- **NumPy**: Calculation errors, performance degradation, crashes
- **OpenAI SDK**: API call failures, memory leaks
- **tiktoken**: Encoding errors, performance issues

#### Probability Assessment
**MEDIUM (40%)** - Based on research:
- Neo4j Driver: Well-tested, thread-safe design ✅
- NumPy ≥2.1.0: Experimental free-threading support ⚠️
- OpenAI SDK: Uses httpx (thread-safe) ✅
- tiktoken: Rust-based, likely compatible but unverified ⚠️

#### Mitigation Strategies

**1. Dependency Version Requirements**
- **Upgrade NumPy**: Change from `>=1.24.0` to `>=2.1.0` (better: `>=2.3.0`)
- **Pin Critical Versions**:
  ```
  neo4j>=5.26.0  # Explicit Python 3.13+ support
  numpy>=2.3.0   # Improved free-threading (June 2025)
  openai>=1.0.0  # Already compatible
  tiktoken>=0.7.0  # Rust-based, monitor
  ```
- **Timeline**: Week 1 of Phase 1

**2. Comprehensive Compatibility Testing**
- **Test Matrix**:
  - Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 (GIL-enabled)
  - Python 3.13t, 3.14t (free-threaded)
  - With/without GIL re-enablement
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Normal operations (parsing, embedding, database writes)
  - Error conditions (connection failures, timeouts)
  - High-load scenarios (100+ concurrent operations)
  - Long-running operations (hours of continuous processing)
- **Timeline**: Weeks 2-3 of Phase 1

**3. GIL Re-Enablement Detection**
- **Implement Runtime Checks**:
  ```python
  initial_gil_status = sys._is_gil_enabled()
  
  # After processing
  if sys._is_gil_enabled() != initial_gil_status:
      logger.warning(
          "GIL was re-enabled during processing. "
          "An incompatible extension was likely imported. "
          "Performance may be impacted."
      )
  ```
- **User Notification**: Log warning with remediation steps
- **Monitoring**: Track GIL re-enablement events in production

**4. Dependency Isolation Strategy**
- **Defer Imports**: Import dependencies only when needed
- **Test Imports**: Check for GIL re-enablement after each import
- **Graceful Degradation**: If GIL re-enabled, continue with ThreadPoolExecutor (still benefits from concurrency)

**5. Alternative Dependency Investigation**
- **Backup Plan**: Identify alternative libraries if critical dependency incompatible
- **NumPy**: Could potentially use PyTorch or JAX as alternatives
- **Neo4j**: Official driver is critical, no alternatives
- **Timeline**: Evaluate during Phase 1

#### Residual Risk
**LOW-MEDIUM** - With proper version pinning and testing, risk is reduced significantly. NumPy 2.3.0+ and Neo4j 5.26.0+ have good track records.

### 3. Single-Threaded Performance Regression ⚠️

**Risk ID**: RISK-003  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Probability**: High  
**Overall Rating**: **MEDIUM**

#### Description
Free-threaded Python has a 5-10% single-threaded performance penalty. Small codebases may experience slower indexing compared to GIL-enabled Python.

#### Impact Analysis
- **Small Codebases** (<50 files): May see 5-10% slower indexing
- **User Experience**: Negative perception if indexing is slower
- **Competitive Position**: Performance regression could deter adoption

#### Probability Assessment
**HIGH (90%)** - This is a documented characteristic of Python 3.14t, not a bug.

#### Mitigation Strategies

**1. Adaptive Processing Strategy**
- **Size-Based Thresholds**:
  ```python
  def should_use_parallel(file_count: int) -> bool:
      MIN_FILES_FOR_PARALLEL = int(os.getenv('MIN_FILES_FOR_PARALLEL', '50'))
      return file_count >= MIN_FILES_FOR_PARALLEL
  ```
- **Small codebases**: Use sequential processing (no overhead)
- **Large codebases**: Use parallel processing (benefits outweigh overhead)
- **Configuration**: Allow users to override threshold

**2. Performance Benchmarking**
- **Establish Baselines**:
  - Measure single-threaded performance on Python 3.14 (GIL-enabled)
  - Measure single-threaded performance on Python 3.14t (free-threaded)
  - Measure parallel performance on Python 3.14t with 4, 8, 16 workers
- **Document Expected Performance**:
  - Create performance comparison charts
  - Set realistic user expectations
  - Provide guidance on when to use parallel vs sequential

**3. User Communication**
- **Documentation**: Clearly explain the trade-offs
- **Auto-Detection**: Log recommendations based on codebase size
- **Example**:
  ```
  INFO: Detected 30 files. Using sequential processing for optimal performance.
  INFO: For parallel processing, use --workers=4 (recommended for 50+ files).
  ```

**4. Configuration Options**
- **Force Sequential**: `--workers=1` or `MAX_WORKERS=1`
- **Force Parallel**: `--workers=N` (override auto-detection)
- **Optimal Default**: Auto-detect based on codebase size

#### Residual Risk
**LOW** - With adaptive strategy, small codebases are not impacted. Only affects users who explicitly force parallel mode on small codebases.

### 4. Database Connection Pool Exhaustion ⚠️

**Risk ID**: RISK-004  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Overall Rating**: **MEDIUM**

#### Description
Concurrent workers may exhaust the Neo4j connection pool, leading to failed transactions, timeouts, and degraded performance.

#### Impact Analysis
- **Transaction Failures**: Workers unable to acquire connections
- **Performance Degradation**: Workers blocked waiting for connections
- **Cascading Failures**: Timeouts leading to retries, further exhausting pool

#### Probability Assessment
**MEDIUM (50%)** - Risk increases with:
- High worker count
- Undersized connection pool
- Long-running transactions
- Network latency

#### Mitigation Strategies

**1. Proper Connection Pool Sizing**
- **Formula**: `pool_size = max_workers * 2` (safety margin)
- **Default Configuration**:
  ```python
  MAX_WORKERS = min(os.cpu_count(), 8)
  NEO4J_MAX_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE = MAX_WORKERS * 2
  ```
- **Validation**:
  ```python
  if pool_size < max_workers:
      raise ValueError(
          f"Connection pool size ({pool_size}) must be "
          f">= worker count ({max_workers})"
      )
  ```

**2. Connection Pool Monitoring**
- **Metrics to Track**:
  - Active connections
  - Pool utilization percentage
  - Connection acquisition time
  - Connection timeouts
- **Alerting**:
  - Warn if utilization > 80%
  - Alert if timeouts detected

**3. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  @retry(
      stop=stop_after_attempt(3),
      wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=2, max=10),
      retry=retry_if_exception_type(neo4j.exceptions.ServiceUnavailable)
  )
  def write_to_database(session, data):
      session.execute_write(tx_function, data)
  ```
- **Backoff Strategy**: 2s, 4s, 8s between retries
- **Max Retries**: 3 attempts before failing

**4. Connection Timeout Configuration**
- **Acquire Timeout**: 30 seconds (sufficient for most cases)
- **Transaction Timeout**: 60 seconds (for large transactions)
- **Configuration**:
  ```python
  driver = GraphDatabase.driver(
      uri, 
      auth=auth,
      max_connection_pool_size=pool_size,
      connection_acquisition_timeout=30.0,
      connection_timeout=60.0
  )
  ```

**5. Graceful Degradation**
- **Adaptive Worker Count**: Reduce workers if connection failures detected
- **Fallback**: If persistent failures, fall back to sequential processing
- **User Notification**: Log recommendations to increase connection pool size

#### Residual Risk
**LOW** - With proper sizing and monitoring, risk is minimal. Connection pool management is well-understood.

### 5. Memory Usage Increase (Immortalization) ⚠️

**Risk ID**: RISK-005  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Probability**: Low  
**Overall Rating**: **MEDIUM**

#### Description
Python 3.13 free-threaded builds immortalize certain objects (functions, modules, classes) to avoid reference counting contention. While improved in 3.14, this may still increase memory usage for large codebases.

#### Impact Analysis
- **Memory Growth**: Proportional to number of modules, classes, functions processed
- **Long-Running Processes**: Memory accumulation over time
- **OOM Errors**: Potential out-of-memory crashes for extremely large codebases

#### Probability Assessment
**LOW (20%)** - Python 3.14 has significantly improved immortalization compared to 3.13:
- More selective immortalization
- Better memory management
- Most issues resolved

#### Mitigation Strategies

**1. Memory Profiling**
- **Tools**: `memory_profiler`, `tracemalloc`, `pympler`
- **Metrics**: Track memory usage throughout indexing process
- **Baseline**: Compare memory usage between GIL-enabled and free-threaded
- **Timeline**: During Phase 7 (Testing & Validation)

**2. Memory Limits & Monitoring**
- **Set Memory Limits**: Use container memory limits (Docker, Kubernetes)
- **Monitoring**: Alert if memory usage exceeds thresholds
- **Thresholds**:
  - Warning: 70% of available memory
  - Critical: 85% of available memory
  - Automatic shutdown: 95% of available memory

**3. Process Recycling (If Needed)**
- **Strategy**: Restart worker processes after N files processed
- **Only If Necessary**: Implement only if memory leaks detected
- **Configuration**: `MAX_FILES_PER_WORKER=1000` (example)

**4. Documentation**
- **Memory Requirements**: Document expected memory usage
- **Guidance**: Provide recommendations based on codebase size
- **Example**: "Indexing a 10,000 file codebase requires ~2GB RAM"

#### Residual Risk
**LOW** - Python 3.14's improvements make this a minor concern. Monitor during testing.

### 6. Iterator Safety Issues ⚠️

**Risk ID**: RISK-006  
**Severity**: Low  
**Probability**: Low  
**Overall Rating**: **LOW**

#### Description
Sharing iterators between threads is unsafe in free-threaded Python, potentially causing duplicate/missing elements or interpreter crashes.

#### Impact Analysis
- **Data Inconsistency**: Files processed multiple times or skipped
- **Interpreter Crashes**: Rare but catastrophic
- **Hard to Debug**: Non-deterministic failures

#### Probability Assessment
**LOW (10%)** - Our architecture naturally avoids this:
- Each worker processes independent files
- No shared iterators in design
- File list is created upfront (list, not iterator)

#### Mitigation Strategies

**1. Code Review Guidelines**
- **Rule**: Each thread must have its own iterators
- **Checklist**: Review for shared state, global variables, class-level iterators
- **Timeline**: During Phase 2-3 implementation

**2. Static Analysis**
- **Tools**: Use linters to detect potential shared state
- **Custom Rules**: Create rules for iterator sharing detection
- **CI Integration**: Run checks on every commit

**3. Testing**
- **Concurrency Tests**: Stress tests with high worker counts
- **Determinism Tests**: Run same codebase multiple times, verify consistent results
- **Edge Cases**: Test with various file orderings

**4. Design Principles**
- **Immutable Inputs**: Pass file paths as immutable strings
- **Isolated State**: Each worker has its own parser, embedder, session
- **No Global State**: Avoid global variables entirely

#### Residual Risk
**VERY LOW** - With proper design, this risk is negligible.

### 7. Production Debugging Complexity ⚠️

**Risk ID**: RISK-007  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Overall Rating**: **MEDIUM**

#### Description
Debugging issues in free-threaded, multi-worker environments is significantly more complex than single-threaded debugging.

#### Impact Analysis
- **Increased MTTR**: Mean time to resolution increases for production issues
- **Development Productivity**: Slower bug fixes and feature development
- **User Frustration**: Longer downtime during incidents

#### Probability Assessment
**MEDIUM (50%)** - Complex concurrent systems inherently harder to debug.

#### Mitigation Strategies

**1. Comprehensive Logging**
- **Structured Logging**: Use JSON format with consistent fields
- **Thread/Process IDs**: Include in every log message
- **Correlation IDs**: Track individual file processing across workers
- **Example**:
  ```python
  logger.info(
      "Processing file",
      extra={
          "file_path": file_path,
          "worker_id": threading.current_thread().ident,
          "correlation_id": correlation_id,
          "executor_type": "thread",
      }
  )
  ```

**2. Observability Infrastructure**
- **Distributed Tracing**: Use OpenTelemetry to track operations
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of:
  - Worker activity
  - Error rates by worker
  - Performance metrics
  - Resource utilization
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized log collection (ELK, Splunk, CloudWatch)

**3. Reproducible Debugging**
- **Seed-Based Randomness**: Use fixed seeds for deterministic behavior
- **Debug Mode**: Special mode with additional logging, single worker
- **State Snapshots**: Ability to dump full state for post-mortem analysis

**4. Testing Infrastructure**
- **Integration Tests**: Cover concurrent scenarios
- **Chaos Testing**: Inject failures to test error handling
- **Load Tests**: Simulate production workloads

**5. Documentation**
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions
- **Debugging Playbook**: Step-by-step debugging procedures
- **Example Scenarios**: Known issue patterns with resolutions

#### Residual Risk
**MEDIUM** - Some complexity is unavoidable, but can be managed with proper tooling.
